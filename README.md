# Practical Course: Web Application Engineerinng with the MERN Stack

## Overview
This repository contains our source code of the web application we built in the practical course *Software Engineering for Business Applications: Web Application Engineering*, which was held by the chair for Software Engineering for Business Information Systems  (Prof. Matthes) during the summer semester 2022. We worked in a group of 4 students and developed an online shop called AirParts, in which customers can rent computer hardware like CPUs or GPUs. We used the MERN Stack to develop our application. As a styling library, we used MaterialUI.  

A quick overview of our business idea is provided in the presentation (business-idea.pdf).


## Project Description
AirParts is a renting service that helps its customers to obtain their desired hardware components for a PC with a few simple clicks.
Our mission is clear: We want to make high-quality hardware affordable for you.  

This repository includes the [front-](/frontend) and [backend](/backend)  of the AirParts webapp.
